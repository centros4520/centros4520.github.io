**Product Tonic Lab (PTL)** is a 6-month, interactive online-based program that focuses on developing product leadership in Southeast Asia through experiential learning. 
<!--more-->
The program was developed by the Product Tonic Community and grounded on our observations over 100 meetups, 2 retreats and 3 unconferences in Southeast Asia. It's organised by community leaders for the community.

## ðŸ‘‰ Why Product Tonic Lab?

In nearly every career progression scenario, the ability to learn new things quickly becomes the critical differentiating skill between hitting a career ceiling versus continual career advancement especially in an industry that naturally evolves rapidly such as technology. To progress in your career, you need to develop the ability to influence, collaborate with, or manage others.

<!-- This is also true in Product. The more senior your position, the less youâ€™re evaluated on what you create, and the more youâ€™re evaluated on what product everyone around you create. -->

This is a program that focuses on coaching/mentoring and walks with you the journey to becoming a product leader yourself. It is designed for senior product managers, product designers and software engineers who want to develop their leadership style, advance in their career and build more impactful products. 

ðŸ“š  **What you will learn** :

- Develop your capacity for Product Leadership
- Product Vision & Principles
- Product Strategy
- Team Structure
- Team Objectives
- Communication / Narratives
- Core Skills in Problem Solving, Negotiation, Facilitating Conversations and Listening
- Product Management, Product Design and Agile Ways of Working

ðŸ’¡ **How you will learn** : 

- Instead of passively consuming the program's content, Product Tonic Lab is designed based on experiential learning; learning through experience. 
- Another program highlight is the facilitated dialogues.  As a participant in the program, you are invited to co-build a safe space to discuss macro issues around climate, education, ethics and sustainable practices in product development.
