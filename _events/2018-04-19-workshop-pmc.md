The My Personal Moral Compass Course (MPMC) is for all Catholics and all people of goodwill interested in formation in the foundations of Ethics and Moral Theology. The objective of this course is for participants to understand and to articulate the fundamentals of moral thinking with greater clarity.

It is a one-year-long systematic course in Moral Theology consisting of 6 individual modules. The modules are:
- Module 1.  Who decides what is right or wrong? 
- Module 2.  Becoming Persons
- Module 3.  Christian Morality
- Module 4.  Ethics of Love, Sex and Marriage
- Module 5.  Christians in the Social Community
- Module 6.  Stewards of Life

In this series of modules, we gain a better understanding of our moral compass, so as to understand the basis of how we come to make our decisions which
gives us then, the freedom to navigate the unpredictable, unchartered roads of our lifeâ€™s journeys
