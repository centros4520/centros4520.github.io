In 2017, the first of the Tourism Innovation Challenges was launched by Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to catalyse the adoption of new technologies in Singapore's tourism industry. The Challenges invited proposals for innovative and viable solutions tailored for the Hotel and Travel Agent industries, and forged successful connections between solution providers and industry players.

 

This year, we turn our attention to the MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Conferences, and Exhibitions) industry. 

 

Meeting, Incentives, Conventions and  Exhibitions (MICE) industry

The Meeting, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) industry is a form of tourism travel, in which groups of people, usually planned well in advance, are brought together for a particular purpose. The MICE market refers to a niche group dedicated to planning, booking, and facilitating conferences, seminars, exhibitions and other events. Players in the field typically include Professional Conference Organisers, Professional Exhibition Organisers, Venue Providers, Destination Management Companies, Tour Operators, Professional Trade organisations, Trade Associations and other suppliers etc. (Find out more information about the industry here .)

 

The industry is a competitive one and set against a backdrop of a rapidly changing global operating environment and evolving consumer needs, many cities competing in this space have also begun to customise and improve their offerings to attract the increasingly sophisticated business traveller. 


The long-term success of Singapore's MICE industry is thus contingent upon the ability to better understand and anticipate delegate needs, and strengthen industry capabilities to deliver the relevant products and services to consumers. It also means the need for all in the industry to collaborate and innovate so that Singapore can remain competitive in the global business events arena.

 

With the technology available today, a lot more can be done to transform the way these events are developed, marketed, and managed.

 

MICE Challenge

To foster technology adoption and enable the MICE industry to stay ahead of the competition, STB partnered SACEOS in 2018 to launch the Tourism Innovation Challenge for MICE, as a means to crowd-source amongst the technology community for new and innovative solutions to address problems faced by MICE companies in Singapore. We are looking for startups / SMEs that have innovative solutions for the MICE industry to enhance their capabilities to design great events and deliver better experiences.

 

Join us at the STB Tourism Innovation Challenge for MICE.  Uncover exciting new business opportunities with event owners, event management services and supporting industries like venues and booth stand contractors!


Designing engaging, world-class events

1. How might we surface and track trends, so that industry can curate more sought-after and forward-thinking content more effectively?
2. How might we enable better matching of MICE industry opportunities to skilled freelancers?

Managing and using customer data more effectively

3. How might we better understand delegates' profiles and needs to customise communications with them, which in turn helps retain their interest for future events?

4. How might we better understand delegates' expectations and needs to provide personalised recommendations, so they get the most of the event experience?

Tracking people movement and event waste
5. How might we pinpoint the location of VIPs or special guests, so that it is more efficient and less manpower intensive to manage them at the event?

6. How might we track or pinpoint the location of vehicles ferrying delegates, so that the event planners can be more responsive to delays and adjust the programme on-the-fly?

7. How might we enable different stakeholders in the event value chain to measure and account for waste generated at each event, so they can develop an appropriate plan to reduce waste?
