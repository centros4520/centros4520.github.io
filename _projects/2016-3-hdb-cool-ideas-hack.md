### Idea: Cool Neighbots

HDB, which provides homes for over 80% of Singaporeans is pivotal in realising Singapore vision of Smart Nation. Stronger community bonds where we live add to a happier, healthier nation. The more connected we are both physically and emotionally, the more the opportunity for us to care for one another.

We proposed HDB Cool Neighbots as smart AI chatbot solution that help us automate connection with and care for our neighbours, share relevant information quickly and easily, and take care of the environment as a community.
