### Idea: GrabHelp for Volunteer

{% include image-full.html file="/2015/8/sih-3.jpg" alt="App Demo" height="430px"  %}

Many Social Organisations lack the ability and knowledge to effectively engage their volunteers and to retain them. This has an impact on the efficiency of the organisation, ultimately limiting the number of people it can help. We proposed GrabHelp for Social Organisations to provide self-help automation for their volunteers activities.
