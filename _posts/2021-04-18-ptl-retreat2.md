## Cowtopia: Behind the Scenes

**Game Hypothesis**

Based on The Culture Game by Daniel Mezick:
- Engagement is essential
- All Agile improvement comes from self management and self organisation, rather than a specific framework or method.

_The top impediment to self-management in teams is a lack of engagement. A primary way of generating a team-level decision is to invite the team to do something.
An invitation is a request for a decision. Decisions are engaging. And only the engaged can self-manage. And self-management is where all the “continuous improvement” comes from. Therefore, inviting is a necessary and essential tool of the trade in Agile coaching._

**Game Roles**  

_Team Captain / Scrum Master_  
Scrum Master is a servant leader - responsible for managing the process of Scrum, protecting the team, and helping remove impediments. She does whats needed to help the team achieve its goals by giving priority attention to the team's needs.  
A huge part of being a Scrum Master is facilitation. She uses her experience with Scrum to help ensure the team is set up for success. She'll act as a mirror for the team, providing them with observations that they may choose to use to improve their work. Scrum Master is responsible for providing the right structure and process to help the team make high quality decisions.  
A good Scrum Master will help protect the team from both internal and external influences so that the team can focus on whats really important: building working software.  

_Product Owner_  
Product Owner is the person responsible for the Return on Investment of the product. She has the responsibility of defining WHAT is to be built and maintains the product vision to set a clear goal for the team and organization. She determines and prioritizes what must be built by using that vision and by gathering requirements from stakeholders so the most valuable things are built first and authority to access if the WHAT that was built is done. 

_Development Team_  
With the Product Owner focused on WHAT the team is going to build, the Team is responsible for determining HOW best to do and deliver their work. Keeping the PO out of implementation helps the team 'think outside the box' and come up with innovative solutions. Unlike traditional project management, the team has the responsibility and authority for making whatever decisions as to when they'll deliver and meet their commitments. 

Overall, Agile software development puts a lot of trust in teams. In fact, you can't have an agile team without letting it self-organize. A good Scrum team is leaderful, not leaderless. The leadership is emergent rather than assigned by an org chart.

**Game Play - Scrum Ceremonies**  

_Sprint Planning_    
The goal of Sprint Planning is for the team to make a commitment to the Product Owner as to what they’ll be delivering in the upcoming Sprint.  
The meeting is timeboxed and consists of two parts: 
- The first half of the meeting is when the Team asks questions of the Product Owner to help clarify the PBIs in question. 
- In the second half of planning, the team breaks down the PBIs to which they are committing into tasks. 
The goal of this meeting is for the team to commit to what they’ll be delivering to the PO by the end of the Sprint. With practice, teams do quite well basing their commitments on the estimates (usually in story points) without having to consider the tasks.”

_Daily Scrum_    
The Daily Scrum is one of our inspect and adapt loops. It’s timeboxed to 15 minutes. The goal of this meeting isn’t to blurt out a status report and fill our time with another meeting. It’s there to help team members synchronize their work. While the Scrum Master is there to listen for impediments he may have to help the team remove, he doesn’t run the meeting. It’s the team members’ meeting, and they self-organize to get it done.

_Sprint Closing_    
The Scrum Framework has two ends to a Sprint:
- The first is the _Sprint Review_ - This is the public end of the sprint where the team demos the functionality they built during the sprint to the Product Owner and the Stakeholders to see progress. 
- The Private end of the sprint comes in the form of the _Retrospective_. This is also one of the inspect and adapt loops we have in the framework. It is only for the team to discuss freely whatever they wish. The sorts of deep conversations teams can have in this meeting don’t happen unless there is a lot of trust between team members. The outcome of this meeting should be 1 to 3 actionable items with the aim of improving their process during the next sprint.

## Leadership
Becoming an effective leader doesn't happen overnight. It's an interative process and requires you to assess your strength and evaluate who you are. We need to develop our own approach to become more effective leader.

**Key Components of Leadership**
{% include image-full.html file="/2021/04/ptlr2-2.png" alt="Topic" caption="Components of Leadership"  %}

**Power**  
_“for an individual to be called a leader, power has to be in the equation”_.   
People don’t follow leaders without power. Knowing the different sources and limits to which one can exercise power in an organizational setting is essential. They are: coercive, reward, legitimate, expert, referent, information, charismatic, and moral.

<!-- - *Coercive* : based on threat, punishment, force, induce fear - can be legit or illegit
- *Reward* : influence behaviors with incentives, bonus
- *Legitimate* : stems from position in organisation, has the ability to direct actions and subordinates acknowledge this power
- *Expert* : has special knowledge, experience or skills. Power is earned through sharing the knowledge
- *Referent* : ability to convey a sense of personal acceptance or approval; influence due to follower's admiration, respect, or identification with the leader. Requires understanding the cultural ways how employees identify with superiors
- *Information* : can be a personal or collective power - based on controlling information needed by others to reach an important goal. This is a short-term power, does not necessarily influence or build credibility
- *Charismatic* : able to articulate a compelling or captivating vision. They are very skilled communicators, eloquent, and able arouse strong emotions in followers
- *Moral* : exhibits through ethical leadership  -  lead followers by their morals & good qualities. Followers may be inspired to replicate leader's actions -->

**Style**  
A leadership style refers to a leader's characteristic behaviors when directing, motivating, guiding, and managing groups of people. A few of the best-known leadership styles are: Authoritarian, Participative, Delegative, Transactional, Transformational, and more recently Servant Leadership. 

<!-- - *Authoritarian* :  
   Decisions are made solely by the leader without the team members' participation or input  
   The leader dictates the policies and processes  
   Team members are supervised and monitored by the leader - a lot of micromanagement 
- *Participative* :  
   The leader would consult team members for their suggestions before making a decision  
   The leader would integrate team members' ideas and options into decisions  
   The leader builds and maintains a collaborative environment 
- *Delegative* :  
   The leader are very hands-off  
   Decision-making is in the hands of the team but the leader remains accountable  
   Team members have a freedom of choice on how to get the job done 
- *Transactional* :  
   Decision-making process is in the hands of the leader whose knowledge and skills are usually superior to the rest of the team  
   Tasks are clearly defined and allocated to team members  
   Rewards & Punishments are distinctly outlined 
- *Transformational* :  
   The leader would expect each team member to contribute to the planning and decision- making process  
   The leader is usually a great visionary of own field 
- *Servant* :  
   Self-less - puts team members ahead of self  
   The leader uses good listening skills and empathy to get input from the team to make informed decisions  -->

**Traits**  
Effective leaders exhibit personality qualities (traits) and characteristics that support their ability to mobilize others toward a shared vision. Understanding these variety of traits can help organizations identify, train, and develop leaders. For example:
- Radiate positive energy 
- Have a proactive attitude 
- Delegate tasks completely 
- Approachable 
- Do what they expect of others 
- Accountable 
- Decisive

**Practice and Inspire it**

Agile leadership is
- Creating an environment of trust 
- Demonstrating and expecting accountability 
- Sharing power with the group 

Agile leadership is not... 
- Always being the nice person 
- Watching the team crash and burn 
- Hold a committee meeting to discuss every decision
