### The Doughnut Theory
{% include image-full.html file="/2021/09/ptl9-1.png" alt="Topic" caption="Doughnut Theory"%}

The Doughnut theory offers a vision of what it means for humanity to thrive in the 21st century. Three things about the Doughnut:
- Contains social and ecological topics
- Goal is to live in the green zone
- Seven ways to think differently: 
  1. Changing the Goal
  2. See the big picture
  3. Nurture human nature
  4. Get savvy with systems
  5. Design to distribute
  6. Create to regenerate
  7. Be agnostic about growth

### Moving from linear to circular economy
Ecological degradation is the result of degenerative industrial process. The economy needs to move from a linear to a circular system and work within the cycle of the living world.

**Sustainable Design Strategies** examples :  
Modularity, Product Service Systems Models, Longevity, Remanufacture, Recyclability, Repairability, Reusability, etc.

**Emerging questions** :  
- HMW shift our mindset to reuse than consume new things?
- HMW create infrastructure and incentives around it?
- how we want to incentivized user to be proactively reuse/recycle their goods
- A lot of consumer product business models rely on continuous consumption --- HMW change this "thinking" to incentivize businesses to create longer lasting, more BIFL (buy-it-for-life) products?
